# Kubernetes-architecture



## Control Plane(Master node)

1) API server - it is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. It serves as the main entry point for all REST API calls used to manage the Kubernetes cluster.
2) etcd - Stores the entire state of the Kubernetes cluster, including information about nodes, pods, services, and other resources.
3) controller manager - Runs various controllers that ensure the desired state of the cluster is maintained.
4) scheduler - Assigns workloads (pods) to nodes based on resource availability and scheduling policies.
5) cloud-controller-manager - allows Kubernetes to interact with the underlying cloud providerâ€™s APIs.

## Data plane(Worker node)

1) kubelet - this is used to talk to the API server and make sure the pods are running accordingly or not
2) kube-proxy - this is a networking component, that assigns the IPs and balances the load.
3) container run time - provides the run time environment for containers to execute.
